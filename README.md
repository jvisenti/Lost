# Lost
A very simple Sprite Kit game featuring a shuttle lost in space.

## Project Setup

- Clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/jvisenti/Lost.git
```

- Run the project in Xcode. This project was constructed in stages, each building on the previous. You may run the project in any of its stages.

**NOTE:** Sprite Kit behaves very poorly on the simulator. It is recommended that you build from Xcode to your device.
